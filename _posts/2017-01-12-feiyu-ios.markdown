Feiyu is an online crowdsourcing platform app that I wrote for the company [SpeechOcean](http://www.speechocean.com/) locate in Beijing, China. A user can earn money by completing small tasks. I have been developing for months with countless hours spending on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [Swift 3 Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/).
